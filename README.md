## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/fahnaladitia/flutter_clean_blox_template.git

# 2. Get packages
flutter pub get

# 3. Run the app
flutter run
```

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Prepare your packages name
```bash
dart run change_app_package_name:main com.yourpackage.name
```

#### 2. üîê Sentry
##### Add your Sentry DSN in main.dart:


```dart
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.dsn = 'YOUR_DSN_HERE';
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
);
```

#### 3. API Base URL
##### Set your API base URL in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart
  static const String baseUrl = 'https://yourapi.com';
  static const String appName = 'Your App Name';
```

#### 4. Handle API errors globally
##### Handle API Errors Bad Request, Unauthorized, etc. in `lib/core/config/interceptors/error_interceptor.dart`:
```dart
if ((err.response!.statusCode ?? 0) >= 401 &&
    (err.response!.statusCode ?? 0) < 500) {
  // TODO: Handle from 401 to 499
  return NetworkException.fromMap(err.response!.data);
 }
```

#### 5. App Links & Deep Links
##### To enable deep linking and app links for both iOS and Android, you need to set up the following (file examples in `applinks/apple_app_site_association and apps/assetlinks.json`):
###### 1. IOS Universal Links
1. Set one value in the appIDs array to `<team id>.<bundle id>`.

2. Set the `paths` array to `["*"]`. The paths array specifies the allowed universal links. Using the asterisk, `*` redirects every path to the Flutter app. If needed, change the paths array value to a setting more appropriate to your app.

3. Host the file at a URL that resembles the following structure.

```bash
# IOS Universal Links
https://yourdomain.com/apple-app-site-association
```
4. Verify that your browser can access this file.

###### 2. Android App Links

1. Set the `relation` array to `["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"]`. The relation array specifies the allowed app links. Using the `delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls` relation redirects every path to the Flutter app. If needed, change the relation array value to a setting more appropriate to your app.
2. Set the `target` object to include the `package_name` and `sha256_cert_fingerprints` of your app. The package_name is the same as the Android application ID, and the sha256_cert_fingerprints is the SHA-256 fingerprint of your app's signing certificate.
3. Host the file at a URL that resembles the following structure.

```bash
# Android App Links
https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```
4. Verify that your browser can access this file.

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.yourpackage.name",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        "YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

#### üìù Notes
- Make sure to replace `YOUR_DSN_HERE` with your actual Sentry DSN.
- Update the `baseURL` with your API endpoint.
- Customize the error handling logic in `error_interceptor.dart` as per your API's error response structure.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations for Sentry in your Flutter project.
